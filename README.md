#### üöß **Work-in-progress**

***

- Create a Projects section that connects to a headless CMS. I want to create a blog that goes into details and specifics for each of my personal and professional software engineering projects.
- Implement web components in order to reuse code and not have to make changes in multiple places (navigation bar, footer, etc).
- The mobile menu should close once a link or button is clicked within the menu.
- Implement the Stripe API and create a page to receive payments for freelance and contract work.
- All images should be compressed and converted to Webp.
- Create a custom confirmation page for my contact form. Right now it's using the default page provided by Netlify.
- Accessibility check: make sure the site follows best practices.

#### ü™≤ **Known bugs**
