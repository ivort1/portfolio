                        Currently based in Los Angeles, CA, I have been working as a software
                        engineer at IKEA since August of 2020. My team consists of around twenty individuals,
                        including frontend, backend, and QA engineers, UI/UX designers, a product manager, and several
                        product owners. Projects I have worked on:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Email template development with XSLT, XML, and Litmus</li>

                        Our team has successfully implemented a pipeline that covers development,
                        staging, and production stages. This pipeline leverages a combination of Docker, Helm charts,
                        Artifactory, and GitHub actions. While I wasn't involved in setting it up initially, I have gained
                        valuable experience working with this pipeline. I have actively participated in modifying Helm
                        charts and have successfully resolved deployment issues within GitHub actions when they
                        arose.

                            To effectively manage our tasks and projects, we utilize Jira as our ticket management system.
                            During our daily standup meetings, we review the Kanban board together, discussing individual
                            assigned tickets and addressing any potential blockers. Our work is organized into sprints, each
                            lasting two weeks. At the end of each sprint, we conduct a retrospective meeting to reflect on
                            what went well and identify areas for improvement.
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            Prior to the start of each sprint, we hold a sprint planning meeting where we collaborate to
                            create new tickets, assign tasks from the backlog, and establish our overall goals for the
                            upcoming two weeks. For seamless communication and updates, all relevant information and
                            comments are recorded within the corresponding tickets. One of our product specialists
                            implemented a helpful integration where creating a new branch in GitHub using a ticket number
                            automatically generates a link within the corresponding Jira ticket, which helps tremendously
                            with tracking progress and collaboration.

                        <div>
                            And finally, we maintain a dedicated Slack channel with automated notifications enabled. This
                            allows us to receive notifications whenever a build is released or if any failures occur, ensuring
                            efficient communication and swift response to any issues that may arise during the development
                            process.

                        the completion of this fourteen-day period, I would promptly commence my duties in the new role.

                        Remote would be my preferred option. I have successfully worked remotely for IKEA since August 2020
                        and am accustomed to collaborating and operating in a digital environment. Despite residing on
                        the west coast, my work schedule is aligned with the eastern time zone, and I’m typically online
                        from 6:30am to 2:30pm PST. Essentially, I am highly adaptable when it comes to my working
                        hours and can adjust them to accommodate the team's needs. I am also open to occasional
                        travel for significant meetings and milestones, as this has been a regular practice in my current
                        role with IKEA. Both on-site and hybrid work arrangements are acceptable as well, however, my
                        commute should not exceed one and a half hours in each direction.

                    <span slot="content">
                        Provided that a relocation package is included, I am open to relocating. My top choices for relocation would be:

                            <li>Dallas, TX</li>

                        I would not be willing to relocate to the following cities:

                    <span slot="content">
                        My target base salary is $160,000, which is based on the current figures I’m seeing for software
                        engineers in the Los Angeles area, insights gathered from recruiters and colleagues, and the
                        high cost of living in Southern California. However, I am flexible regarding this figure, particularly
                        if the compensation package includes stock options and an annual bonus. While I value fair
                        compensation, my priority is joining a great company with an exceptional team and engaging
                        projects that allow me to expand my knowledge base. I am more than willing to have a
                        constructive discussion about my salary, as I don’t want it to be the determining factor in
                        considering my suitability for a role.
