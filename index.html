                        <span slot="content">
                            Currently based in Los Angeles, CA, I have been working as a software
                            engineer at IKEA since August of 2020. My team consists of around twenty individuals,
                            including frontend, backend, and QA engineers, UI/UX designers, a product manager, and several
                            product owners. Projects I have worked on:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Email template development with XSLT, XML, and Litmus</li>
                            <li>Frontend development utilizing React, JavaScript, Sass, and React Storybook</li>
                            <li>Backend development using Java and Spring Boot</li>
                            <li>React mobile development using Capacitor</li>
                            <li>Cloud-based work with Google Cloud Platform and its services such as BigQuery,
                                Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Storage, Cron Job, and more.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </span>

                        <span slot="summary">What is your work authorization status?</span>
                        <span slot="content">
                            I am a US citizen and do not require sponsorship of any kind, now or in the future.

                            In line with professional etiquette, I would tender my two-week notice to my
                            current employer on the same day that I sign a new employment contract. Following
                            the completion of this fourteen-day period, I would promptly commence my duties in the new role.

                        <span slot="content">
                            Remote would be my preferred option. I have successfully worked remotely for IKEA since August 2020
                            and am accustomed to collaborating and operating in a digital environment. Despite residing on
                            the west coast, my work schedule is aligned with the eastern time zone, and I’m typically online
                            from 6:30am to 2:30pm PST. Essentially, I am highly adaptable when it comes to my working
                            hours and can adjust them to accommodate the team's needs. I am also open to occasional
                            travel for significant meetings and milestones, as this has been a regular practice in my current
                            role with IKEA. Both on-site and hybrid work arrangements are acceptable as well, however, my
                            commute should not exceed one and a half hours in each direction.

                        <span slot="summary">Are you willing to relocate?</span>
                        <span slot="content">
                            Provided that a relocation package is included, my top cities would be:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Temecula, CA</li>
                                <li>San Diego, CA</li>

                            I would not be open to relocating to the following locations:
                            <ul>
                                <li>San Francisco, CA</li>

                        <span slot="summary">What is your desired salary?</span>
                        <span slot="content">
                            My target base salary is $150,000 - $250,000, which is based on my experience, the current figures I’m seeing for software
                            engineers in the Los Angeles area, insights gathered from recruiters and colleagues, and the
                            high cost of living in Southern California. However, I am flexible regarding this figure, particularly
                            if the compensation package includes stock options and an annual bonus. While I value fair
                            compensation, my priority is joining a great company with an exceptional team and engaging
                            projects that allow me to expand my knowledge base. I am more than willing to have a
                            constructive discussion about my salary, as I don’t want it to be the determining factor in
                            considering my suitability for a role.
