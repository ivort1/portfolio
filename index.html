                        <span slot="content">
                            Based in Los Angeles, CA, my career as a software engineer began in August 2020. I have experience collaborating with professionals from various specialties such as frontend, backend, and QA engineers, UI/UX designers, product managers, and product owners. Some of the projects I have undertaken:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Email template development with XSLT, XML, and Litmus</li>
                            <li>Frontend development utilizing React, JavaScript, Sass, and React Storybook</li>
                            <li>Backend development using Java and Spring Boot</li>
                            <li>React mobile development using Capacitor</li>
                            <li>Cloud-based work with Google Cloud Platform and its services such as BigQuery,
                                Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Storage, Cron Job, and more.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </span>

                    <custom-details>
                        <span slot="summary">What is your work authorization status?</span>
                        <span slot="content">
                            As a US citizen I do not require sponsorship of any kind, now or in the future.
                        </span>
                    </custom-details>

                        <span slot="content">
                             A preference is given to permanent full-time roles, although contract-to-hire positions could be considered depending on the company.
                            <br></br>
                            Contract work, however, is not a consideration at this time.

                        <span slot="content">
                            Remote would be my preferred option as I am accustomed to collaborating and operating in a digital environment. At one of my last positions, despite residing on
                            the west coast, my work schedule was aligned with the eastern time zone, and was typically online
                            from 6:30am to 2:30pm PST. Essentially, I am highly adaptable when it comes to my working
                            hours and can adjust them to accommodate the team's needs. I am also open to occasional
                            travel for significant meetings and milestones. Both on-site and hybrid work arrangements are acceptable as well, however, my
                            commute should not exceed one hour in each direction.
                        </span>

                    <custom-details>
                        <span slot="summary">How soon would you be available to start in a new role?</span>
                        <span slot="content">
                            In line with professional etiquette, I would tender my two-week notice to my
                            current employer on the same day that I sign a new employment contract. Following
                            the completion of this fourteen-day period, I would promptly commence my duties in the new role.
                        </span>

                        <span slot="content">
                            Relocating would not be an option at this point in time.
