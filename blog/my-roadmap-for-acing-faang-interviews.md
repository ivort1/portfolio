Navigating the labyrinth of resources, both free and paid, that promise the secret to acing FAANG interviews and securing a $300,000 annual salary can be overwhelming. The research process alone uncovers a plethora of sites, books, courses, YouTube channels, blogs, and more, enough to make anyone’s head spin. The challenge lies not just in studying and preparing for the FAANG interview, but in deciding which tools to utilize for the task.

Outlined below is my general roadmap for interview preparation, with more detailed and comprehensive blog posts on each topic to follow:

1. **Choose a Programming Language** – The language of choice should ideally be one that is most familiar. For those starting from scratch or without a strong grasp on any particular language, Python is the de-facto choice for interviews, followed by Java, C++, and JavaScript (the latter specifically for front-end roles). Because I plan to also apply to front-end roles, JavaScript/TypeScript is my chosen language for this interview preparation journey.

2. **Learn Data Structures and Algorithms** – This was without a doubt the most grueling and challenging task when assembling my roadmap. There are just *so* many books, MOOCs, YouTube channels...it's just...a lot. The final selection included <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grokking Algorithms</a>, <a href="https://www.structy.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structy</a>, and YouTube for additional clarification as needed.

3. **Practice Coding Problems** – <a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode</a> stands as the gold standard. The problem sets to be tackled include <a href="https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grind 75</a> and <a href="https://neetcode.io/practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neetcode 150</a>.

4. **Practice System Design** – The resources of choice are System Design Interview volumes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/139-6466936-8800513?pd_rd_w=OUUBY&content-id=amzn1.sym.101c7dca-f8ef-4330-838b-ed6e9ebb9e52&pf_rd_p=101c7dca-f8ef-4330-838b-ed6e9ebb9e52&pf_rd_r=3X573FQ7QCAJMTQMGEH2&pd_rd_wg=u4UnS&pd_rd_r=d2f800d0-5cfd-41ae-9475-6cc2f9f87db7&pd_rd_i=B08CMF2CQF&psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide/dp/1736049119/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/139-6466936-8800513?pd_rd_w=yaV52&content-id=amzn1.sym.101c7dca-f8ef-4330-838b-ed6e9ebb9e52&pf_rd_p=101c7dca-f8ef-4330-838b-ed6e9ebb9e52&pf_rd_r=B1NVS2X9ARCEYK7DSZY8&pd_rd_wg=KSLCH&pd_rd_r=d73af8ac-d8b0-4d9c-971c-5b13e0dab0f3&pd_rd_i=1736049119&psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_2/139-6466936-8800513?pd_rd_w=QYbRU&content-id=amzn1.sym.101c7dca-f8ef-4330-838b-ed6e9ebb9e52&pf_rd_p=101c7dca-f8ef-4330-838b-ed6e9ebb9e52&pf_rd_r=RBCFDNTZZ42Q5P5KSYV0&pd_rd_wg=95RCi&pd_rd_r=a4991b8a-e2b2-4546-9f06-fd5dfb56236c&pd_rd_i=1449373321&psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>.

5. **Build a List of Answers for the Behavioral Round** – <a href="https://www.tryexponent.com/blog/what-is-the-star-method-and-how-to-use-it-during-interviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The STAR method</a> serves as the guide for formulating responses to potential questions.

6. **Construct a Solid Resume** – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This template found on Reddit</a> has proven successful over the past two years, yielding interviews with companies such as Disney, CrowdStrike, Attentive, and more. <a href="https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/harvard-college-guide-to-resumes-cover-letters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard University</a> also recommends this format so one could say its merit has been proven. This template will continue to be utilized.

7. **Apply** – Referrals will likely be necessary for all FAANG companies, possibly excluding Amazon. This will depend on the hiring landscape in 2025.
