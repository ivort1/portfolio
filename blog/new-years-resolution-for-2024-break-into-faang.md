For many software engineers, the ultimate career goal is to secure a position at one of the FAANG companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. Although the acronym may need an update—Facebook is now Meta and Google is part of Alphabet—the term has come to represent any big tech company offering high compensation. This broad definition could encompass Nvidia, Microsoft, Adobe, Airbnb, Open AI, various trading firms such as Jane Street and Citadel, and many more.

However, the path to these coveted roles is not easy. Software engineers arguably face one of the most grueling interview processes compared to other professions. A typical interview loop involves a screening phone call with a recruiter, followed by one to six technical coding challenges, a system design interview, and a behavioral interview. During each technical coding round, candidates are observed via webcam or in person as they attempt to solve a coding problem (sometimes two) in less than forty-five minutes. They are expected to verbalize their thought process while solving the problem and even if it is solved correctly, an inefficient solution in terms of time and space complexity could still result in a failed round.

Despite the challenging interview process, the compensation can be life-altering. It’s not uncommon for new graduates to earn over $200,000 at Meta, Google, Apple, and Amazon. Netflix is unique in that it compensates its employees in all cash instead of offering stock options. Websites like <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Northrop%20Grumman,Disney&track=Software%20Engineer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Levels.fyi</a> and <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blind</a> provide a glimpse into the earning potential in this lucrative field. Based on data from Levels.fyi, half of all senior engineers earn an annual total compensation of $324,000. Meanwhile, staff engineers and principal engineers earn yearly total compensations of $482,000 and $601,000 respectively.

This blog was created to document the journey towards achieving the goal of receiving an offer from one of these companies in 2025. There’s also an intention to start a YouTube channel but uploading videos on a regular basis might be challenging. For now, this blog will serve as the primary platform for sharing this journey.
