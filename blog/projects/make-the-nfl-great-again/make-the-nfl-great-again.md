# Make the NFL Great Again

My fantasy football league was founded in 2015 and as the commissioner of a league you're always looking for ways to improve and spice up the experience for your members. The first two years of the league were hosted on ESPN, then we made the transition to Yahoo, and finally decided to make the move to Sleeper in 2023. Aside from offering more detailed customization, Sleeper offered an API that made it possible to collect data about our league and its members.

It was perfect for my needs and thus I set out to build a website that would keep track of statistics, league champions, transactions, and more. I had also started writing Power Ranking articles where each week I wrote about each team and ranked them from worst to best
